firstly i want to thank skill harvest for giving me this kind of opportunity to achieve my dream in becoming a data analyst also i want to thank my facilitator Mr for also impacting the knowledge in us he was really amazing all through the course of our training, he was phenomenal 

All through the course i was able to learn about 
- Microsoft Excel
- Google sheet Query
- Gifhub
- Power Bi

- Microsoft excel: for excel i was able to know the introduction of excel, foundation of data, basic excel functions, Reports and dashboard, Data sources which includes On premises,cloud e.t.c

  i will like to take you through all the learning i achieve in excel. But firstly what is Microsoft Excel

  Microsoft Excel is a versatile spreadsheet software developed by Microsoft, used globally for organizing data and performing financial analysis. Its key features include data entry, management, financial modeling, and charting. Excel is extensively used in finance and accounting for budgeting, forecasting, and analysis due to its robustness and flexibility. It supports various functions, formulas, and shortcuts to enhance productivity and efficiency. Excel is a vital tool for professionals in finance, accounting, and other fields requiring data organization and analysis.

  They are some terms in Microsoft excel which i also learnt about during the course of the training and they are as follows

**Workbook**
A workbook is a file that includes one or more Worksheets. A new workbook can be created from another blank workbook or a template. Simply go to the Blank Workbook option from the File tab on the Ribbon, or just press CTRL + N.

 **Worksheet**
A Worksheet, also called a spreadsheet, is a collection of cells in which you can enter and calculate data. Cells are arranged into columns and rows in a worksheet. Multiple worksheets can be arranged and stored in a Workbook.

**Row**
The group of all the cells that run horizontally in an Excel sheet is called a Row. The numbering on the left side of a worksheet denotes the row numbers. In the following picture, The highlighted area signifies row 7.

**Column**
The grouping of cells that run vertically in an Excel sheet is called a Column. The alphabetic numbering that can be seen at the top of the sheet denotes the column numbers. In the image below, B denotes the column that is highlighted.

**Cell**
The boxes that are seen in a worksheet within the horizontal and vertical gridlines are called Cells. The cell name is a combination of the row and column numbers where it is located. In the image below, the highlighted cell is denoted with the name C9, meaning it is located at the intersection of column 9 and row C.

**Ribbon**
The Ribbon is the area where tabs and icons are arranged in rows in the upper portion of the worksheet. It is like a complex toolbar. Click commands on the ribbon to perform the specified operations those commands represent. The highlighted area shows the location of the ribbon in Excel.

**Quick Access Toolbar**
In Excel, the command bar that appears above or below the primary ribbon tabs is called the Quick Access Toolbar. It provides constant visibility and easy access to a set of preferred commands.

**Function**
Functions are built-in formulas to perform various calculations in Excel. In order to perform a function properly, you need to input the required arguments for the function in the specified order.

For example, the formula
=AVERAGE(D3:D12)
returns the average value of the cells from D3 to D12. After inputting the equal sign and writing AVERAGE as a function, the cells whose values should be averaged need to be defined. If arguments are not entered in the correct order, the intended result will not be returned.

**Formula**
A Formula in Excel is simply an equation. We use formulas to perform calculations, manipulate cell data, check if data meets conditions, and so on.

For example, here we use the
=SUM(D3:D12)
formula to calculate the sum of cells D3:D12.

Also i learnt about cell referencing and the types of cell referencing which are the 

- Absolute Referencing: is referencing a particular value that will be constant all through ($j $24). the $ sign means it is constant irrespective of either row or column
- Row constant: it is making the row value constant e.g J$20
- column constant: you making the column value constant e.g $J30
